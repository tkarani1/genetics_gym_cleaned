Joining the VSMs happened in three main stages. 

1. Create VSM and linker
Extract raw scores + format for each VSM (new_VSMs_scripts.py)
Create linker (linkers.py)

2. Join each VSM onto the linker (join_VSMs folder) 
  group by and coalesce such that there is one score per locus, allele, ensg 

3. Join all VSMs together (joining_all_SNP_gene.py)
