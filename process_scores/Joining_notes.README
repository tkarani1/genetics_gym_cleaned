Joining the VSMs happened in four main stages. 

1. Extract raw VSM scores (new_VSMs_scripts.py)

2. Create linker (linkers.py)
  Add fixed uniprot ids (join_new_uniprot folder)

2. Join each VSM onto the linker (join_VSMs folder) 
  group by and coalesce such that there is one score per locus, allele, ensg 

3. Join all VSMs together (joining_all_SNP_gene.py)
